v1.101018
	CHANGE.		Operation 'bitwise'.  The first input is the expression, subsequent inputs are named.
				All numbers are integers and are treated as base 16 (hexadecimal) including constants.
				0x Prefix is optional. Both "0x134" and "134" are evaluated to the same number.
				x - y; x + y; x * y; x / y; x % y; and(x,y); xor(x,y); not(x); or(x,y); 
				abs(x); pow(x,y) y; max(x,y); min(x,y); shl(x,y) y; shr(x,y) d; rol(x,y,z); 
				ror(x,y,z);

v1.101011
	Enh.		Operation random. takes 2 values representing the high/low values of the interval.
				so eg. precision 0 with inputs 1 and 2 will return either 1 or 2. 
				But precision 1 with the same inputs will return 1.0,1.1,1.2,1.3, ... 2.0
				The precision attribute affects the number of decimal points (and therefore the size of the interval)
	BUG:		In errors, mysql password was being shown. Now it is obscured with eg: p******d.

v1.100930
	Enh.		encoder: deflate. Returns a binary deflate of what is passed to it.

				Added the ability for http object to accept body also.
v1.100823
	Bugfix.		Field references within control resolving to current iteration. 
v1.100729	
	Enh.		OBYX_SQLPER_REQUEST - fastcgi support for multiple database connections.
				This doesn't allow for multiple databases per request, but allows a fastcgi
				process to handle different database settings per request. As each group of settings
				requires a new connection, fastcgi works faster when this is not set.
				However, for virtual hosts sharing the same fastcgi binary, this should be declared.
v1.100728	
	Bugfix.		Fixed issues regarding cli database connection. 
v1.100720	
	Enh.		Additional digest encoders md5/sha1. New sysenv OBYX_LIBSSLSO
				Obyx can now use libssl to digest dataitems. Digests are returned hexencoded.
				Initial syntax level support has been made for md5,sha1,sha512. 
				md2,md4,sha,sha224,sha256,sha384,dss1,mdc2,ripemd160 are also ready to implement.
				At some point soon, I shall add in crypto operations to instruction. 

v1.100717		(probationary) Though this has passed most tests, the refactor requires more in situ tests.
				For production services it is better to stay with v1.100709 until 
	Enh.		Additional Iteration operation: each - enables regex-based searches across spaces.
				The field accessor is #key.
	Refactor.	IKO evaluation has been broken down into space over usage_test.
				This has dramatically reduced the code complexity, at the expense of changing some of the errors.
				Removal of boolean evaluation tests on the main execution line.
				booleans were a legacy from when fields were evaluated only at the time of their iteration.
				field itypes have been evaluated at parse time for quite some time (since before v1.09).
				In general, iko evaluation error reports are a more consistent.
	Bugfix.		Several bugs deleted - including empty-value errors, and overly deferred evaluation. 
v1.100715
	Enh.	Additional Comparison operation: found - enables regex based searches across spaces.
v1.100709

v1.100625

v1.100607
	Enh.	Added support for OBYX_DEFAULT_ROOT_DIR

v1.100506
	Bugfix. Fixed metafield Bug.
v1.100430
	Bugfix. No need to return an existing cached DTD grammar. 
v1.100427
	Prof.   Stopped preloading the SOAP/WSDL grammars. The existing performance hit is too great.
v1.100419
	Enh.    Added support for fatal# and debug# on itype space="error"
v1.100416
	Bugfix. Match: When value is set, additional values cause hidden error. 
	Bugfix. Major problem with OSI compile. CGI needs to be correctly mapped to RFC headers.

v1.10.03.19
	Bugfix.  request cookies with changed expiry persist in response.
	Bugfix.  version missing from CURRENT_RESPONSE xml.

	Tidy.    authorship/licensing information corrected. (cut and paste errors)

v1.10.03.11
	Bugfix.  when OBYX_VALIDATE_ALWAYS is set, allow for anonymous xml.
v1.10.03.10
	Bugfix.  DOCTYPES now persist except for fragments. fragments lose DOCTYPES (and entities will therefore break)
v1.10.03.08
	Log Enh. Support for OBYX_SYSLOG_OFF
	Bugfix.  http output remove_methods had reversed output logic.
	Bugfix.  over-enthusiastic error report for scope attribute.
