Obyx INSTALL file. 
HTML versions of this file can be found at http://www.obyx.org/en/1/installationdebian.html

Please send bug reports to <bugs@obyx.org>
Obyx can be compiled from code using a small number of supporting libraries. 

This file explains how the code can be compiled under Debian Linux to get a working version of Obyx.
It is assumed that Apache and MySQL are already available, configured and running.

Installation Process

This installation guide consists of the following steps:

	* 1. Preparation of host: Application support installation
	* 2. Preparation of host: Library installations
	* 3. Set up Server File Structure
	* 4. Download source code (SVN)
	* 5. Set up compile settings
	* 6. Compile obyx.cgi binary
	* 7. Configure HTTP server
	* 8. Test

**** 1. Preparation of host: Application support installation

It is assumed MySQL/PostgreSQL and Apache are already installed and working.
The Obyx source code is C++ and requires gcc/g++ compiler to compile.
The source code is stored in a SVN repository, so svn is necessary to get it.
Installation here is provided using the aptitude tool as an example. 

	g++ Compiler (>= 4.1)
    deb: g++ 
	$sudo aptitude install g++

	svn
    deb: subversion 
	$sudo aptitude install subversion


**** 2. Preparation of host: Compile-time Library installations 

Obyx relies on a number of supporting libraries at compilation time.
Installation here is provided using the aptitude tool as an example. 
In most cases the development version of libraries is required.
With the runtime libraries, there is still need for headers.

** Compile-time

xercesc 3.01
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi

xqilla 2.2.2
http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/HomePage
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=152021

** Run-time: 

libpcre: Used to handle regular expressions within Obyx.

    deb: libpcre3-dev 
    $sudo aptitude install libpcre3-dev

libcurl: This library provides network access utilities

    deb: libcurl3-dev 
    $sudo aptitude install libcurl3-dev

libmysql: This library provides database connectivity with MySQL
    deb: libmysqlclient15-dev 
    $sudo aptitude install libmysqlclient15-dev


**** 3. Setup Server File Structure
The structure and location of files on the host server is flexible and controlled by configuration files. 
However, the following is suggested and used in this installation:

	/WWW_ROOT/public    - location of publicly accessible .html, .css, .obyx files.
    /WWW_ROOT/logs      - location of log files
    /WWW_ROOT/scripts   - location of Obyx run script files
    /WWW_ROOT/cgi       - location of Obyx binary and any other cgi scripts
    /WWW_ROOT/source    - location of Obyx source code

   $mkdir -p /WWW_ROOT/public
   $mkdir -p /WWW_ROOT/logs
   $mkdir -p /WWW_ROOT/scripts
   $mkdir -p /WWW_ROOT/cgi
   $mkdir -p /WWW_ROOT/source

**** 4. Download source code (SVN)
The Obyx source code is currently available in a SVN repository.
To checkout the source code do the following from the ~/RSapps directory:

	$cd /WWW_ROOT/source
	$svn co http://svn.obyx.org/obyx/supported/version1 obyx

To update the source files any later time 

	$cd /WWW_ROOT/source/obyx
	$svn update

**** 5. Set up compile settings
Before trying to compile the code some settings need to be setup. 
The file local.cfg contains compile settings specific to your setup. 
Amend the file as necessary. 

MYSQL_INC	Should point to the mysql include directory.
CC_INCLUDES Any additional include directories needed for the compilation. (each needs to be prefixed by -I)
CC_PATH		The path to gcc/g++
CC_DB		These are defines used to include or exclude compilation of the mysql or postgresql code.
			If you do not have postgresql or mysql, remove the -DALLOW flag for the salient item to prevent headers 
			from not being found.
CC_FLAGS	The normal set of additional gcc flags used for this compilation.
RPATH		The full path to the root directory of the www files as mentioned above.
			Importantly, this only MUST be the parent of the cgi directory to install to.
CGIDIR		The relative path to the cgi directory. It must be underneath RPATH.

/WWW_ROOT/source/local.cfg:
MYSQL_INC   = /usr/include/mysql
CC_INCLUDES = -I$(MYSQL_INC)
CC_PATH     = /usr/bin/
CC_DB       = -DALLOW_MYSQL -DALLOW_POSTGRESQL 	
CC_FLAGS    = -x c++ -funsigned-char -fno-asm -Wno-trigraphs -g -O3 -fmessage-length=0 $(CC_DB) $(CC_WARNA) $(CC_WARNB)
RPATH       = /WWW_ROOT
CGIDIR      = cgi

**** 6. Compile obyx.cgi binary

	$cd /WWW_ROOT/source/obyx
	$make /WWW_ROOT/cgi/obyx.cgi

To check that the linking is correct one can do:

	$ldd /WWW_ROOT/cgi/obyx.cgi


**** 7. Configure HTTP server
Http (Apache2) Configuration.
Apache needs to know how to handle .obyx files. 
The following basic apache server configuration file can be used as a basis.

<VirtualHost YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:80>
	DocumentRoot  /WWW_ROOT/public
	ServerName    host.yourdomain.com
	RewriteEngine  on
	RewriteRule    ^/$   /index.html [R]

#####  Obyx configuration ########
	<IfModule mime_module>
		AddHandler  cgi-script				.cgi
		AddType		application/obyx+xml	.obyx
		Action      application/obyx+xml	/o/obyx.cgi
	</IfModule>

	ScriptAlias  /o/			  /WWW_ROOT/cgi
	<LocationMatch "^/o/" >
		Order Deny,Allow
		Deny from All
		Allow from env=REDIRECT_STATUS
	</LocationMatch>

#obyx runtime will be able to access any files/directories under the OBYX_ROOT_DIR directory
#eg using filename /foo.html will actually be pointing to /OBYX_ROOT_DIR/foo.html
#the scripts directory, which is used by the 'shell' operation should be outside OBYX_ROOT_DIR.

 SetEnv OBYX_DEVELOPMENT       on
 SetEnv OBYX_ROOT_DIR          /WWW_ROOT/public
 SetEnv OBYX_SCRIPTS_DIR       /WWW_ROOT/scripts
 
 SetEnv OBYX_SQLSERVICE        mysql  (or postgresql)
 SetEnv OBYX_SQLDATABASE       YOUR-DATABASE-NAME
 SetEnv OBYX_SQLHOST           YOUR-DATABASE-HOST
 SetEnv OBYX_SQLPORT           YOUR-DATABASE-PORT
 SetEnv OBYX_SQLUSER           YOUR-DATABASE-USERNAME
 SetEnv OBYX_SQLUSERPW         YOUR-DATABASE-USERPASSWORD

#set the following, if debugging or using breakpoints in obyx files.
 SetEnv OBYX_DEVELOPMENT       true	
	
#There are some settings for using custom paths to dynamic libraries
#For Mac OS X, which has a dylib suffix, they are mandatory. 
#Mac OS X uses dylib suffix
	SetEnv OBYX_LIBCURLSO         /usr/local/lib/libcurl.dylib
	SetEnv OBYX_LIBPCRESO         /usr/local/lib/libpcre.dylib

#MySQL Library location	(if using MySQL)
	SetEnv OBYX_LIBMYSQLCRSO      /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient_r.dylib
	SetEnv OBYX_LIBZIPSO          /usr/lib/libz.dylib

#PostgreSQL Library Location (if using PostgreSQL)
	SetEnv OBYX_LIBPQSO           /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.dylib
    
##### End Obyx Configuration #####
</VirtualHost>

**** 8. Test

Example Obyx Hello World

The two following files may be used to test that Obyx is working. 
It uses both an SQL connection and a filesystem include to test some basic functionality. 
The files should go into your public directory (e.g. /WWW_ROOT/public ):

Run the hello world example by going to http://www.yourdomain.com/hello_world.obyx
You should simply see the words "Hello World" in a valid html page.

hello_world.obyx

<instruction xmlns="http://www.obyx.org" >
   <input>
       <instruction note="load view">
           <output space="store" value="v" />
           <input space="file" value="hello_world.html" />
       </instruction>
       <iteration operation="sql" note="get model">
           <output space="store" value="v#//*[@id='msg']/text()" />
           <control value="select 'Hello World' as message" />
           <body space="field" value="message" />
       </iteration>
       <instruction note="display view">
           <input space="store" value="v" release="true" />
       </instruction>      
   </input>
</instruction>
